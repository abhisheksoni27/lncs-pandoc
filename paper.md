        Security of passwords and authentication issues in general are issues
        of high importance. Nevertheless a huge rate of passwords isn't secure
        enough and could be.

# Introduction

In almost every authentication process a password is required. There are a lot
of services and applications with password authentication and the amount of
passwords to remember increases continuously. Unfortunately in many cases 
the chosen passwords aren't secure enough. Which means they can be cracked
e.g. by dictionary attacks. But even if you have chosen a secure password there
are other risks e.g. the service it is for could leak it. At this point
two factor authentication could be a security improvement. Two factor
authentication in general consists of something you know and something you own.
The YubiKey is a hardware token for two-factor authentication. It's the physical
part within the two-factor authentication.



## Why to use a YubiKey

## Idea behind YubiKey

[^ZFS]: A combined file system and logical volume manager designed by Sun Microsystems
[^BTRFS]: ,,B-tree FS" A copy-on-write linux file system with similar features
to zfs
