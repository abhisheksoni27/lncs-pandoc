abstract: | 

    Docker is a new approach to deployment targeted at making distributing
    software easier and faster. Instead of true hardware virtualization,
    software is run in containers which are easily reproducible and can be
    versioned. The containers can be easily exchanged either raw of over
    a common platform like DockerHub. Besides deployment, docker can be used
    for tasks like sandboxing, creating testbeds for small to large
    applications and generally as an alternative for many usecases where
    hardware virtualization was used previously.
